# Cursor Guardrails — Chatbot with Memory

You MUST follow these rules for any task in this repo:

1) Default to minimal diffs. Delete > add.
2) Do NOT change UI/UX or functionality unless explicitly requested.
3) Do NOT add dependencies without explicit user approval.
4) Do NOT generate automation scripts (Playwright/Satori/fonts/downloads) unless explicitly requested.
5) Before edits: produce a 5–10 line plan.
6) After edits: provide a diff summary + commands run.
7) Always run: npm run typecheck && npm run build && npm run lint before proposing a commit.
8) If the request is hygiene/docs-only: edit only docs/config; never touch app code.
9) Never rewrite git history (no force push, no rebase) unless explicitly requested.
10) Keep README accurate; remove stale references (React/CRA/FastAPI/GCP/Cloud Run/etc.).
