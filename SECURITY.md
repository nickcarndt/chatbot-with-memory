# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public issue

**Do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. This could put other users at risk.

### 2. Report privately

Please report security vulnerabilities privately by emailing:

**Email**: [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)

### 3. Include the following information

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact of the vulnerability
- **Environment**: OS, Python version, Node version, browser
- **Proof of concept**: If you have a proof of concept, please include it
- **Suggested fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue

### 4. Response timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution**: Within 30 days (depending on severity)

### 5. Disclosure timeline

- **Coordinated disclosure**: We will work with you to coordinate public disclosure
- **Timeline**: Typically 90 days from initial report
- **Credit**: We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep dependencies updated**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
   
   # Frontend
   npm update
   ```

2. **Use environment variables for secrets**
   - Never commit API keys to version control
   - Use `.env` files for local development
   - Use secure secret management in production

3. **Validate input data**
   - The application uses Pydantic for input validation
   - Always validate user input on both frontend and backend

4. **Use HTTPS in production**
   - Never send sensitive data over HTTP
   - Use proper SSL/TLS certificates

5. **Regular security audits**
   ```bash
   # Backend security check
   pip install safety
   safety check
   
   # Frontend security check
   npm audit
   ```

### For Developers

1. **Follow secure coding practices**
   - Use parameterized queries (SQLAlchemy ORM handles this)
   - Validate all input data
   - Sanitize output data
   - Use proper error handling

2. **Keep dependencies updated**
   - Regularly update Python packages
   - Regularly update Node.js packages
   - Monitor for security advisories

3. **Use security tools**
   ```bash
   # Python security scanning
   pip install bandit
   bandit -r app
   
   # Frontend security scanning
   npm audit
   ```

4. **Implement proper authentication**
   - The current version doesn't include authentication
   - For production, implement proper authentication (JWT, OAuth, etc.)
   - Use secure session management

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Implementation

1. **No Authentication**
   - The application currently has no authentication
   - Anyone can access the API endpoints
   - This is acceptable for development/demo purposes

2. **CORS Configuration**
   - CORS is configured for localhost development
   - Production deployment should restrict CORS to specific domains

3. **API Key Storage**
   - OpenAI API keys are stored in environment variables
   - Never commit API keys to version control

4. **Database Security**
   - Uses SQLite for simplicity
   - No database authentication
   - For production, use a proper database with authentication

### Production Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Implement proper authentication
- [ ] Use HTTPS everywhere
- [ ] Configure proper CORS
- [ ] Use a production database (PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Use secure session management
- [ ] Implement proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Security testing and penetration testing

## Security Updates

### How we handle security updates

1. **Immediate response**: Critical vulnerabilities are addressed immediately
